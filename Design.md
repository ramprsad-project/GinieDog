For implementing a Parental Control application for Android, the best fit design pattern would be the **Observer Pattern**.

**Observer Pattern**:
The Observer pattern is well-suited for scenarios where one object (the subject) needs to notify multiple other objects (the observers) about changes in its state. In the context of a Parental Control application, this pattern is ideal for notifying the parent's device about activities or events happening on the child's device. For example, when the child accesses a restricted website or attempts to open a blocked app, the parent's device should be notified.

**How it works**:
1. **Subject (Child's Device)**: The child's device will act as the subject in this pattern. It will maintain a list of observers (i.e., the parent's devices) and provide methods to subscribe and unsubscribe them.

2. **Observers (Parent's Devices)**: The parent's devices will act as observers. They will register themselves with the child's device as observers and provide a method (callback) that will be called when specific events occur on the child's device.

3. **Event Notification**: When a relevant event occurs on the child's device, it will notify all registered observers by calling their respective callback methods.

**Advantages of Using Observer Pattern**:
- **Decoupling**: The Observer pattern decouples the child's device from the parent's devices, making it easy to add or remove observers without affecting the subject's logic.
- **Extensibility**: New types of observers (parent's devices) can be added easily without modifying the subject's code.
- **Flexibility**: Different types of notifications can be sent to different observers based on their needs.

**Example Scenario**:
Let's say you have a Parental Control app installed on both the child's and parent's devices. The child's device will act as the subject, and the parent's devices will be the observers. The app's architecture would look something like this:

```
Subject (Child's Device):
- Maintain a list of observers (Parent's Devices)
- Provide methods to subscribe and unsubscribe observers
- Notify observers about specific events (e.g., restricted website accessed)

Observers (Parent's Devices):
- Register with the child's device as an observer
- Implement a callback method that is called when events occur on the child's device
```

When the child accesses a restricted website, the child's device (subject) will notify all registered parent's devices (observers) about this event. The parent's devices can then take appropriate actions based on the notification, such as sending a notification to the parent or logging the event.

Overall, the Observer pattern provides a clean and efficient way to handle communication between the child's and parent's devices in a Parental Control application for Android.
