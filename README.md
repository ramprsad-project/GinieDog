To get started, let's outline the steps we'll need to take:

#### Set up development environment:

> - Install Android Studio for Android development.
    Set up a C# development environment, such as Visual Studio with Xamarin.
    Install PostgreSQL and set up your database.
#### Plan your application:

> - Define the features and functionality you want to implement.
> - Create a wireframe or mockup to visualize the user interface.
#### Implement the features:

> - Implement GPS Tracker: 
You can use Android's Location API to track the device's location.
> - Implement Hidden Keylogger: A hidden keylogger is not recommended due to ethical concerns.
> - Implement WhatsApp Spy: You cannot spy on WhatsApp or any other messaging app without violating privacy and legal rules.
> - Implement Contact Log Tracker: You can use Android's Contact Provider to track changes in contacts.

> - Implement Facebook Spy: You cannot spy on Facebook or any other social media app without violating privacy and legal rules.
> - Implement Control Panel: Create a user interface for parents to view monitored data.
> - Implement Hidden Android Call Recorder: A hidden call recorder may be illegal and unethical in most cases.
> - Implement Internet Browsing History Tracker: You cannot spy on internet browsing history without consent, but you can track it with permission.
> - Implement Photo/Video Capturer: You can use Android's camera API to capture photos and videos with permission.
#### Database Integration:

> - Use C# code to interact with the PostgreSQL database for storing relevant data.
#### User Authentication and Security:

>- Implement secure user authentication to protect access to the application.
#### Testing and Debugging:

>- Test your application thoroughly on different Android devices and OS versions.
>- Debug and fix any issues that arise during testing.
#### Deployment:

>- Prepare your application for deployment on the Google Play Store.
